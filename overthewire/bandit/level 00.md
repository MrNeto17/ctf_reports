# Log in with bandit0
In this level I started by setting up a kali linux VM to conclude this levels. 

Then I had to log into the ctf server using SSH. Using the credentials given by the overthewire I ended the level with this screen.

# Finding Bandit1 pwd

Being logged in with bandit0 I went to find the password for level1 that was in a "readme" file.

To do this I just needed to list the files to confirm the "readme" exists. To do this I used the "ls" command and after seing it exists, I printed the file with "cat readme" command.
