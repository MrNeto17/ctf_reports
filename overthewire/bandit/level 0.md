# Finding Bandit1 pwd

Being logged in with bandit0 we want to find the password for level1 that is in a "readme" file.

To do this we just need to list the files to confirm the "readme" exists. To do this we do the "ls" command and after seing it exists, we will print the file with "cat readme" command.
