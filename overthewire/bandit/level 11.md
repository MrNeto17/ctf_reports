# Finding flag for level 12

In this exercise I had again the flag in a data.txt but this time it each character was rotated 13 times.

Even tho I know there is ways to do it directly in the linux terminal I took the chance to use python to take the rusty off. Getting first the encoded message with:

```bash
    cat data.txt
