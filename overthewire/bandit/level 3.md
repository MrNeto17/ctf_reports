# Finding pwd to level 4

Now, the objective is to find a password in a directory called inhere, but the file is hidden.
To find the hidden file we will use a trick by using the tab with cat command and a ".".

I listed the files in the home directory using the ls command and identified the directory named inhere. After navigating into it with cd inhere, it listed the files inside using ls and noticed a file with the name ...Hiding-From-You. To read its content, I used the cat ...Hiding-From-You command, ensuring I typed the exact filename. This revealed the password for the next level. Shortly after, my session timed out due to inactivity, and I was automatically logged out.
